# Rep invariants and abstraction functions

Using the following code as example:
```ts
class CharSet {
  private s: string;
  /* ... */
}
```

Then the *rep space* R contains strings, and the *abstract space* A contains
the mathematical sets of characters. We can show both values geographically,
with an arrow from a rep value to the abstract value it represents, as seen in
[this][] graph.

It is worth noting that:
  - **Every abstract value is mapped to by some rep value.** The whole purpose
    of implementing abstract data types is to offer support for operations on
    abstract values. So all abstract values must be representable.
  - **Some abstract values are mapped by more than one rep value.** The
    representation is not a tight encoding. There is more than one way to
    represent a set of unordered characters as a string.
  - **Not all rep values are mapped**. In this case, the string "abbc" is not
    mapped, because it was decided that the rep string should not contain
    duplicates.

The graph as a whole is infinite, so we can only illustrate a few elements and
their relationships. We describe it by the following:

1. An ***abstraction function*** that maps rep values to abstract values they
represent:
> AF: R → A
2. A ***rep invariant*** that maps rep values to booleans:
> RI: R → bool

For a rep value *r*, RI(*r*) is only true if *r* is mapped by *AF*. In other
words, *RI* tells us if the given rep value is well formed.
