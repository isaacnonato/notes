# Coverage
It is important to cover all the code in a testing suite. There are three different kinds of coverage:

- Statement coverage: asserts that at least every statement is run by the test case.
- Branch coverage: asserts that in every `if` and `while` statements both `true` and `false` paths are taken by the test.
- Path coverage: asserts that every combination of branches -- that is, every path of the program -- are taken by the test.

The order of magnitude of each coverage is Path >= Branch >= Statement.
Full statement and branch coverages are acceptable, but full path coverage is impossible, as it would need a very large number of test cases.
