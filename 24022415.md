# coupling power and chain rule

if $f$ is a differentiable function of $u$, and $u$ is a differentiable function of $x$, then substituting $y=f(u)$ in the Chain Rule Formula <br>
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}$$
Leads to: <br>
$$\frac{d}{dx}f(u)=f'(u)\frac{du}{dx}$$ 

For example, if $u$ is a differentiable function of $x$ and $n$ is an integer, and $y=u^n$: <br>
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{d}{du}(u^n)\cdot\frac{du}{dx} \\
= nu^{n-1}\frac{du}{dx}$$
