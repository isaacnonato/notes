# Static and dynamic types

A *static* type is the type declared type of a certain variable, example:
```ts
let arr:ReadonlyArray<string> = ["abc"];
let obj:Object = arr;
```

In this example, the static type of `arr` and `obj` are, respectively,
`ReadonlyArray` and `Object`.

The *dynamic* type is the type a certain object points to at runtime. Using the same example, `arr` is initialized to point to the value of an array literal `["abc"]`, therefore is of type `Array<string>`. The dynamic type of the variable `obj` is also `Array<string>`, since `obj` and `arr` are aliases to the same `Array` object.
