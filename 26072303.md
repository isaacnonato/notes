# Never return a direct reference to a field in a class

This may cause *rep exposure* and allow the client to modify the field. Example:

```java
class Triangle {
  private double[] sides;
  
  public double[] getSides() {
    return sides;
  }
}
```

The above code may allow for the  client to replace the `sides` field with another array. 
It is good to always return a copy of the field.
