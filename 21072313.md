# SIGINT signal

The *SIGINT* signal can be handled by Node.js. *SIGINT* is the signal that is sent whel Ctrl+C is 
pressed on the terminal. 
Example:
```javascript
console.log(`Process ID: ${process.pid}`);
process.on('SIGHUP' , () => { console.log('Received SIGHUP') });
process.on('SIGINT', () => { console.log('Received SIGINT') });
setTimeout(() => {}, 5 * 60 * 1000); // keep the process alive
```

When the process with the code above is run in a terminal, pressing Ctrl+C won't stop it, since
the default *SIGINT* handler was replaced with a user-made one.

If Ctrl+D is pressed, the program will be terminated, since the *SIGKILL* signal will be sent and 
this signal cannot be handled by Node.
