# How unhandled promise rejections are handled in Node.js v15 and above

In Node.js v14, unhandled promise rejections didn't cause the process to crash (though this could be 
changed with the `--unhandled-rejections=strict` flag when running de Node binary).
In Node v15 and above, unhandled promise rejections will cause the process to crash by default.
