# Signals

Signals are a mechanism provided by the operating system to send short "messages" from the kernel to
other processes. Signals are usually just a numbers and are commonly represented by string such as 
*SIGINT* and *SIGKILL*.

*SIKILL* and *SIGSTOP* are the only signals that cannot be handled by any programs, when a process receives one of these signals, it is terminated immediately.
