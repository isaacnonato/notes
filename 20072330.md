# Specifications

A **specification** is necessary in order to make our functions more human-readable.
A specification consists of a **precondition**, which is, what is necessary for the function to run,
and a **postcondition** which is the effects of the function. An example, in Java:

```java
/**
 * Find a value in an array
 * @param arr array to search, requires that val occurs exactly once in arr
 * @param val value to search for
 * @return index i such that arr[i] = val
 */
 static int find(int[] arr, int val) { ... }
```
In the example above, `@param` is the precondition, and `@return` is the postcondition
