# Defensive copying

To avoid *representation exposure*, it is crucial not to return class fields
directly. Instead, only a copy of them should be returned. 
# Example
```typescript 
class Tweet {
  private readonly timestamp;
  private readonly author;
  private readonly text;

  public constructor(author: string, text: string, timestamp: Date) {
    this.author = author;
    this.timestamp = timestamp;
    this.text = text;
  }
  /**
     * @returns Twitter user who wrote the tweet
     */
    public getAuthor(): string {
        return this.author;
    }

    /**
     * @returns text of the tweet
     */
    public getText(): string {
        return this.text;
    }

    /**
     * @returns date/time when the tweet was sent
     */
    public getTimestamp(): Date {
        return this.timestamp;
    }
}
```

Considering the above code, the following code may be problematic:
```typescript
/**
 * @returns a tweet that retweets t, one hour later
 */
function retweetLater(t: Tweet): Tweet {
  const d: Date = t.getTimestamp();
  d.setHours(d.getHours()+1);
  return new Tweet("jamie", t.getText(), d);
}
```

The problem here is that the `getTimestamp()` call returns a reference to the
same `Date` object referenced by `t`. `t.timestamp` and `d` are aliases to the
same mutable object. So when the date `d` is changed, the field on the `t`
object is also changed, therefore breaking the `Tweet` object immutability.

This is where defensive copying comes in, instead of directly returning the
`timestamp` field, a copy of it should be returned, so it won't directly
interfere with the object's mutability:

```ts
public getTimestamp: Date {
  return new Date(this.timestamp.getTime());
}
```

It is worth noting that mutable types often have a `copy` method to create a
new instance of the object.
