# Keeping the state outside the application

It is important to keep services stateless. That is, the application's state need to be outside the 
application's code. 
The *Single Source of Truth* is philosophy that says there must be a single location outside the 
application code where the state must be kept. If the data is kept in two separate locations, 
these two sources may diverge. And that is bad for multiple reasons, for example, if the application
data is kept only in one application process and the process crashes, the only copy of the data 
is lost.
