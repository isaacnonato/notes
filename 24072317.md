# Operations of abstract data types

Abstract data types have 4 types of operations:

- Creators (t* -> T): those create the type from a certain input from other type.
- Producers (T+, t* -> T): create another object from old objects of the type.
- Observers (T+, t* -> t): take objects of the abstract types and return one of a different tyle.
- Mutators (T+, t -> void | t | T): change the object.

# Examples
- The `String` primitive data type in Java:
  - creators: `String` constructor (`new String()`)
  - producers: `concat`, `toUpperCase`
  - observers: `length`, `charAt`
  - mutatos: none
- The `List` data type in Java:
  - creators: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList` constructors
  - producers: `Collections.unmodifiableList` (taken from class, did not understand this one)
  - observers: `size`, `get`
  - mutators: `add`, `remove`, `addAll`, `Collections.sort`
