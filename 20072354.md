# Null references
 
In Java, references to objects can have the *null* value, which means the reference does not point
to an object.
Primitives values, however, cannot be null:
```java
int size = null; // invalid
doublt depth = null; // invalid
```
The compiler will reject above attempts as static errors.
Non-primitives values can have null values:
```java
String name = null;
int[] points = null;
```
The compiler will accept values such as above, however, methods cannot be used
