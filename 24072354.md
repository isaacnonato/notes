# Here-strings in bash

In bash, the `<<<` symbol makes a here-string. Instead of typing text, a pre-made string can be given
to a program, these strings are `here-strings`.

Here-strings create a temporary file that can be acessed by the file descriptor in the Shell program.
The file is deleted right after the variable is used.

For an example, open a terminal and try `ls -l /proc/self/fd/ <<< "TEST"`
