# The abstract value space and the rep values space

The *abstract value space* consists of the values the abstract type is designed
to support. For example, TypeScript's [`BigInt`][], an abstract type for
unbound integers, would have the mathematical integers as its abstract value
space.

The *representation value space* (often referred as *rep space*) consists of
the objects that actually actually implement the abstract values. For example,
a `BigInt` value may be represented using an array of digits, represented by
`number` values. The rep space would be the set of all such arrays.
