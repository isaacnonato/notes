# Invariants

Invariants are properties of abstract data types that are *always true*.
Invariants are **always** immutable. There are multiple types of invariants,
sometimes they are variables (`i: number` means that `i` is always) a number.
They can also be relationships between variables (e.g. `0 <= i < array.length`)
or properties from the variables(e.g. `i.size() <= 2`).
