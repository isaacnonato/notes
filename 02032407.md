# Host Byte Order and Network Byte Order

Computers store numbers in *Host Byte Order*, which can be Little-Endian or Big-Endian depending on the machine. Howerver, Networks use the *Network Byte Order*, which will always be Big-Endian, so, when building packets and working with network applications it is better to ensure the two and four byte numbers are in the Network Byte Order, this can be done by the `htons` and `htonl` ("`h`ost `to` `n`etwork `s`hort and `h`ost `to` `n`etwork `l`ong"). There are also functions to convert from the Network Byte Order to Host Byte Order (`ntohs` and `ntohl`), so, when sending out stuff on the network, assure they are in the Network Byte Order, and when they are coming in, ensure they are in the Host Byte Order.
